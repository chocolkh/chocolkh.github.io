# Github 
The main purpose of github is to keep everyone on the same page. Normally development work are performed in large group setting (or at least multiple developers for single project), it is pretty difficult to make everyone on the samepage. Github provides everyone's communication channel, especially with the team's code. 

## Is Github going to be useful for single person's work? 
In constrast to the Github's general purpose, I will not work with others for this page. Definitely I am working with other team members at work and we use our own SVN, but this page would be my own page. The contents will be uploaded and maintained soley by myself, K LEE. Then, why do I need github and why did I spend couple of hours to set github page and the blog? 

## Own traking is necessary. 
I know how to write code. I used to use fortran, C, matlab and python for image processing and numerical simulation. However, everytime I used those program, I have some issues to track or follow my own work. Therefore I need some method to track and monitor the progress. I need some tools like scrivener. Also, I will be using multiple computers at work, at home and at somewhere else. So, I need some clolud based storages to access my code.
