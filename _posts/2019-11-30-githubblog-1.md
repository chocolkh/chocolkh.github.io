# Github 
The main purpose of github is to keep everyone on the same page. Normally development work are performed in large group setting (or at least multiple developers for single project), it is pretty difficult to make everyone on the samepage. Github provides everyone's communication channel, especially with the team's code. 

## Is Github going to be useful for single person's work? 
In constrast to the Github's general purpose, I will use github for simpler purpose - sharing among my computers. Although it is highly inefficient, I am using 4 different computers based on location and purpose. So I need some space to store and enable sharing my codes with all 4 machines. Definitely I am working with other team members at work and we use our own SVN, but this page would be used for my personal project. 

## Why github blog? 
Okay, then why do I need github blog? I already have two other blog pages which are my official blog and personal log book. However, I relized that I need some development log book to track my code. I use fortran, C, matlab and python for image processing and numerical simulation. However, everytime I write some codes, I have some issues to track or follow my own work. Therefore I need a simple method to track and monitor the progress. Basically, I need some tools like scrivener. Also, I will be using multiple computers at work, at home and at somewhere else. So, I need some clolud based storages to access my code and blog to track the code.
